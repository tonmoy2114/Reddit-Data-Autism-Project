      "I think most of us have seen these clickbaity things and, while some may be legitimately talented and touching/heart-warming, at the same time it kind of feels like we're being stereotyped and paraded around like a dog and pony show for social media in similar fashion to what the media has done to other marginalized groups.  I realize that these videos also help to humanize the autistic community to the rest of the world, and build a certain base level of awareness, and complaining about it probably won't change it, but it still feels a bit icky and cheap to me.  Anyone else have these kinds of feels?\n",

      "Also it's supposed to make others feel better about interacting with the likes of us - as in 'Hey! This weird rude person who did my cake a weird way is actually autistic and doing the best they can. This turns things around. Maybe they aren't all stupid smelly people after all!'\n",

I'm sorry but I would feel kind of bad for ANYONE who worked at mcdonalds for 30 years! And then this christmas tons of dying cancer children \"uplifting\" news kept getting posted and ending up on /r/all.\n",

There's a lot of them where something terrible happens and then someone helps the person who the terrible thing happened to. I mean that's nice, but I don't really feel happy if a major part of the story is the bad thing that happened.\n",

      "Upvoted for feeling bad for anyone working there for 30 years.  Lol\n",

      "The only thing I liked about that latest one - the Irish schoolgirl singing - was that the school is actually pretty neat and it made me grin to see a school who lists \"resources for ASD pupils\" right next to the list of holidays. Other than that they could've tagged it without the \"autistic\" part and I would've still been impressed....her voice is beautiful.\n",
      "Yes it's a capturing video, as any cute child who sings so well.   The problem I have is that it is an incomplete picture.  Either the girl is only slightly affected and has learnt well to overcome most of the hassles.  She clearly had a talent to mimic and recall the song.  I wonder if this talent is primarily a copy of something she has watched many times. Behind it she may have other problems unseen and challenging. This they do not share so people see her as extraordinary.  Though also a setup as not all future things will ever be as supported and broader expectations will increase.  \n",
      "Any short video about any person will be an incomplete picture - it's no more incomplete *because* she's autistic. Autistic people have varied skills and abilities just like everyone.\n",
      "Yes as most of the time I feel the videos are insulting in subtle ways. \" watch me ask out this teen with autism because I feel bad for him, not because I actually want to date him \" sort of deals. Part of me makes it feel like people with disabilities are being portrayed as circus animals here to make others feel good about themselves.\n",
      "Yeah, exactly. The very fact that they decided to film it and include in the description that the person is autistic is othering. It makes it seem like it's a special good deed to include autistic people in regular activities.\n",
      "I feel like the have a tendency to give the wrong idea about our capabilities. \n",
      "I mean I absolutely understand we all function at different levels, but it is sometimes seems like they're implying we are infants and it's magical a kid with autism could do something \"normal\"\n",
      "To piggyback off this, I feel the same way when I see news talk about \"This person with autism/similar psychological problem(s) was chosen as homecoming/prom king or queen because [insert feel good reason here]\". It comes across as belittling and insulting putting people on a pedestal only because of their disability.\n",
      "I get annoyed by any attempt at emotional manipulation, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I wonder how funny it would be to make videos of NTs managing to do things that aspies stereotypically find easy? \"So inspirational how Bob managed to avoid being ripped off by an in-your-face salesman!

      "You and me both.  I was raised by emotionally manipulative people (father is textbook Narcissistic Personality Disorder, mother is textbook Histrionic Personality Disorder).  It's left me with a really strong aversion to manipulative behaviors.   The moment someone starts trying to manipulate me is the moment I shut them down, reduce their importance in my life, and withdraw any potentially exploitable connections to them.\n",
      "Yes! This. \n",
      "I honestly only see them posted on /r/autism occasionally, and I don't tend to frequent many places online where they're likely to show up so perhaps it's easier for me to say they don't bother me because I rarely see them. When I do see them I tend to ignore them.\n",
      "I personally kind of hate /r/autism with a passion for that reason. Seriously... it's not a circus show people. I feel like that sort of attention is why it's so hard to navigate life as an adult with ASD. \n",
      "It seems like it's that way because more parents visit that subreddit. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few mild irritations on the autism subreddit - these videos are one and the greater tendency for drama (and not just from non-autistic people) is another. I stay subscribed but post less there than here.\n",
      "[There's a really great speech on this ('inspiration porn') by the fantastic Stella Young](https://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much). This kind of stuff doesn't actually humanise autistic people, but instead goes, *can you believe these incapable people can do some mildly achievable thing*. It's to inspire nt people, not humanise autistics. It doesn't look at these people as individuals, but rather vehicles of a disorder. It's like how there's a thing where people like to diagnose any mildly eccentric successful person (present or past) as autistic, as if the main contributing feature of autism is exceptional abilities which benefit broader society. Autistic people are more than our 'special interests'.\n",
      "Shame she died. She was a great speaker and a great disability advocate.\n",
      "Media is like that old freak shows, where they exhibit people who are different from the \"normal\" to amuse others or to make them feel nice things. It happens whit every kind of person who fails to be in the \"normal zone\": fat people in tv, people with autism, homeless people, etc. It is awful and cruel and morbid.\n",
      "Yeeeessss! I hate it so much when I see those. It boils us down as just *autistic* and it shows that people think we are less capable than them. I'm always like, if they weren't autistic would you still be sharing it?\n",
      "Yeah. I feel they're using us for clicks.\n",
      "r/savedyouaclick is for you\n",
      "I'm mixed on it. Some of comments here point out that the achievements seem rather 'mundane' to them. Some comments hint at even feeling insulted that others accomplishing such a 'simple thing' makes them appear or feel 'stupid' themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "What people seem to forget is that some are not as fortunate to be higher on the spectrum, so those \"mundane\" things can be quite the feat for that individual. Maybe it wouldn't be an accomplishment for you, but it very well may be for that child. I think that's a really poor view to hold--throwing people on the lower functioning end of the spectrum under the bus because it hurts one's own image. How is that *any* better?  I understand parents wanting to be proud of their child accomplishing something that may be considerably more difficult to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, I get the frustration with some using people with autism as little more than icon or a tool to uplift their own image. So there's really two sides to this in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I'm rather neutral about them. Some move me, others don't--perhaps even frustrate me.\n",
      "To be perfectly blunt and non-jokingly self-deprecating about this, with a lot of these self-conscious Aspergers you can really tell they are autists. They never stop to think that there are Aspergers/autists who may have problems with their condition, they are completely oblivious to the suffering autists outside of their own little constructed Asperger world, and they will readily rationalise their suffering away as unrelated comorbidity. The thought that maybe they are part of an absolute minority of autists -what with their ability to actually competently attend university and achieve a degree- and that their experience is so removed from the majority of autists that they are really little more than a quirky \"NT\", never crosses their mind.\n",
      "To me, it depends on the tone of the piece. Sometimes I see videos of a person with doing something most seem mundane and they focus on the obstacles that person overcame and the hard work they exhibit. That's awesome. But sometimes it's worded in a way that says \"Autism makes you barely human, so good on one of them for being kind of normal!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you know what I mean. They generalize and make autism seem like one big disability that's the same for everyone, and can result in people underestimating the abilities of anyone on the spectrum. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, if it comes from a place of integrity or education, it can be fine. All too often it can be insulting. \n",
      "You worded this better than I could figure out how to - the comment about feeling bad about someone working in McDonald's for 30 years was the one that stood out for me. That's an imposition of one person's views and opinions onto another persons. I supported a young man with Down Syndrome in the first few months of his employment at Sainsbury's a few years back - he's still there and enjoys his work. I wouldn't like working at Sainsburys but I am not him, and I have no place judging whether his goal of working at Sainsburys is \"worthy\" or makes him a \"role model\" because he is happy with his job.\n",
      "I agree with a lot of this, but it's also that these reports are so poorly written/titled that no one realises autism is a spectrum disorder and therefore autistic people who are in the position of finding this stuff to be mundane are treated as some sort of rare miracle by anyone who finds out or disregarded as they should be assumed as to be too \"stupid\" (ie not capable of a lot of things they are) to do anything.\n",
      "Fucking makes me sick honestly. We shouldn't be 'exploited' by the media for their sensationalist stories! \n",
      "Its annoying for all people who struggle with anything. Its similar to telling someone who is severely depressed to just snap out of it.\n",
      "I still have a goal of becoming president and then doing a bunch of great stuff, and then telling people about my autistic brain. Once and for all, changing people's perspective.\n",
      "I think most of us feel the same or similar to you. It's really only to the benefit of NTs, I try to ignore it when I see it but it does annoy me for the rest of the day\n",
      "If you seen a cat, climb a tree, to then go onto the roof a building to see its owner. You'd be amazing, surprised, but its a lot harder and a bit stupider then going up the stairs to the rooftop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate these videos because I makes me feel like an idiot, incompetent to every meaning of the word. Seeing someone who's autistic do mundane tasks I and I'm sure most of us do every day. \n",
      "\n",
      "How about this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3PJovwwRkw. I don't think NT's will see this, but I view this as the kid being treated like a dog. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm amazed by anyone that can hula hoop.  \n",
      "Never been able to get the hang of that either despite extensive attempts when I was a kid.\n",
      "I was able to do it like once when I was 8\n",
      "It's annoying as all hell because I'm not a clever autistic, I don't have any special talents, I'm not a computer whiz or anything. \n",
      "Do you have any special interests?\n",
      "Yes, archery. But I'm not very good at it, lol. Ah well. I'll certainly never be on any inspiration porn videos! \n",
      "Just have someone film you constantly until you hit a bullseye. Inspiration achieved\n",
      "Magic of video editing right? /s \n",
      "I've considered getting into that, but I couldn't afford the equipment. I enjoy activities that require intense moments of concentration. Having those makes it worthwhile. \n",
      "Most clubs here will loan you the equipment, as your measurements, weight you can pull etc change as you learn. \n",
      "I think this describes the majority of autistics.  The strange thing for me remains is that this is the minority among what we see on the Internet or at least in \"Asperger's\" boards.  And you definitely don't need to be gifted or crazy clever to have Asperger's.\n",
      "For ages I thought I wasn't clever enough to be autistic, that I didn't fit the requirements. I now know better thankfully but this stuff doesn't help those who don't. \n",
      "Don't worry too much about it.  A lot of guys aren't good at anything and still they're often able to find love, romance, intimacy etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trick is to learn to like yourself regardless of what \"skills\" you have.\n",
      "I'm a girl, lol, and yeah, I'm engaged to an aspie. The arguments aren't fun but thankfully few and far between now. \n",
      "I wish it was possible to be a guy who has no direction in life and still attract women.  I know that now contradicts what I said in my previous comment, but oh well.  Sometimes I like to be positive, other times less so.\n",
      "It's hard to be positive I know :) \n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of us really have a direction in life, but we're OK with that. We earn enough to pay the rent and bills and do things we enjoy, at least. \n",
      "I'm in the same boat as you, and I hope in the future, people realise there's a middle-ground between \"Autistic supergenius\" and \"Severely impaired Autistic person\".\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I remember once my dad said if I just studied more I could have been a supergenius.\n",
      "Most people could be what people call \"supergeniuses\" if they just studied/practised more. But they aren't, simply because they are unable to dilligently practise to the required degree. Studying hard is the most important part of the equation.\n",
      "This is roughly the reaction I get after a successful interaction with a small child or infant. It's well known in my family that I'm not particularly comfortable around children, which apparently means I should receive attention and praise for not trying to eat it or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "My problem isn't even with children per se. It's more with people who have less than predictable patterns of behavior, which for the most part is children. Of course I have also met more than a few adults who fall into that category.\n",
      "I sort of identify.  I like kids ok though.  More to the point, I like *well behaved* kids.  Unpredictable adults make me way more nervous than unpredictable kids though.\n",
      "It's like watching a cat use a human toilet. An odd analogy, I know, just stick with me for a minute. \n",
      "All cats are perfectly able to use the toilet. It's not in their DNA as it is for them to use the box and bury their waste, but physically and intellectually, It's not that big a deal. Now recall A scene in meet the parents, as a surprised and confused Ben Stiller opens the door to the bathroom.\n",
      "Most people don't know that cats can be trained at all, let alone to use the toilet. So when they see a cat doing something it was trained to do, it's either treated as very impressive, so cute, or completely unbelievable. The fact that the cat is doing something relatively normal escapes entirely. \n",
      "In most of these videos featuring someone on the spectrum, the normality of the situation escapes in the same way. Naturally, a child on the spectrum wants to have friends over for his or her birthday. Of course an adult with Aspergers desires advanced training to improve in their field. Had I not said \"on the spectrum\" and \"With Aspergers\" the previous two statements would be similar to the statement \"Snow appears white as it falls\". As soon as the spectrum is added into the equation, The obviousness fades into the background. It's as if the spectrum is visible and the colors on it are too bright to see beyond them. \n",
      "I like your analogy, that's something I can rework to articulate this matter to others IRL.\n",
      "See how this autistic child so readily accepts the hugs and touching from the pedophile. \n",
      "I don't know whether to chuckle or cringe at that statement.\n",
      "Yea, I know.. As Apies we seem to have a natural defense against those creeps, but we need to break our habits of not wanting that closeness which opens up for the pedos.\n",
      "Me being 68, I have faith that most of the young aspies out there will work through just about everything. I sometimes feel sorry for the NT's out there being so normal.\n",
      "Why not both?\n",
      "I think they're dumb. It's not even that I think that because I'm autistic, it's just stupid self gratifying attention whoring.\n",
      "I dislike it. I hate ANY form of misrepresentation's or spreading iof misinformation through any method.\n",
      "I dislike ignorance and irrational behaviour that stems from people being completely unaware of what Autism is, stating obvious bullshit about Autism then when corrected act like they don't care and that people telling them that they're wrong makes the people correcting them bad people for educating others.\n",

       "'I\\'m getting married :) (and a thank you to this community)\\nHi guys :)\\n\\nSorry it\\'s been a while since I have been around. After my assessment I took some time to really think about what I wanted to do next. I struggled with my confidence but have had a lot of support from my SO, who still believes in me and wants me to have the right diagnosis. He\\'s been unwavering and I\\'ve leaned on him a lot. He\\'s amazing and I\\'m so lucky to have him.\\n\\nAnd so today we set a date to get married! We\\'re tying the knot on 5th May, with our sons and parents present.\\n\\nWe\\'ve wanted to get married since before the birth of our son, but many things happened that made us push it back. There was the struggle within our family because of my brother\\'s needs (which are overwhelming, he needs masses of support) and then the diagnosis of our son. With two autistic sons and an autistic brother planning a wedding felt too huge. Add to that my own discovery of my Asperger\\'s and then my failed assessment, and it was too much to deal with. But now we feel like we\\'re finally going to get there. It\\'s what we\\'ve wanted for a really long time and we\\'re doing it, it feels surreal!\\n\\nIt\\'s going to be an incredibly small wedding with just our immediate family, but it has to be. We have the needs of our sons and my own needs to consider, and my brother will need someone to care for him that day so my mother can attend. But it won\\'t be the most basic one either because to get a basic ceremony we would have needed to wait until September. We have booked a suite at the local Town Hall which we\\'ll need to decorate somehow. Hopefully we can get it right, as we don\\'t have a lot of time and money, and as I said I\\'ve got to make it Autism friendly.\\n\\nI just thought I\\'d share this with you guys as a way of saying thank you. I haven\\'t been around much, but you guys have been really supportive and talking to you helped me come to terms with my Asperger\\'s, even if it is just self-diagnosed for now. In real life there\\'s only my SO and my mother that recognize it, so talking to you guys really helped. I hope things are going well for you all, and I can\\'t thank you enough for helping me feel strong enough to take this step with the most supportive, caring and amazing guy in the world :)\\nAh Yay! Congrats! I did a secret-ish town hall wedding and then a \"friends and family\" ceremony a year later. Having it in town hall makes things sooo much simpler and less stressful. Just enjoy yourself :)\\nI have this weird impulse to recommend a blue hair ribbon, so here I am, doing that. I can offer no explanation. \\nCongrats! Me and my S/O are planning a city council (English version of a town hall, pretty much) marriage and then making an event out of it later with family and friends. \\n\\nSmall ceremonies are much less stressful that way, and I personally think it\\'s actually preferable, because it\\'s also much more private! I\\'m super happy for you all, and good luck! :D \\nYay! Congratulations! That\\'s wonderful news. Very happy for you!\\nCongratulations! :-)\\nCongratulations! \\n\\nI too am an aspie who married an NT and decorated my own wedding venue. We arranged with the venue to rock up around 5pm the night before the ceremony. I bought a load of ribboning from a warehouse at a bulk discount (in the colours we were going to be dressed in the next day). We turned up, shoved some ribbon in the room as a small group of family/friends. We then had a meal together in town before heading home for the night. It was a very easy and relaxed way to do it, so hope this helps.\\nCongratulations! That\\'s so exciting!\\n\\n\\nJust like other comments, I had a practically-eloped wedding as well. It was just his immediate family (parents and siblings) and my grandparents and brother since the rest of my immediate family is out of state. We didn\\'t have a get-together with friends or anything, it was very private and quiet (in fact the whole thing start to finish took about 5 minutes). When people are surprised to find out we\\'re married I always say \"If you exclude everyone then no one feels excluded\" XD Small weddings are highly underrated so you\\'ll probably love it! =D \\nCongratulations to both of you and may your marriage last many years! I am also a self diagnosed female aspie who married an NT and somehow we have made it work. We will celebrate our 30th anniversary this summer. \\n\\nWe had a very small ceremony, my mother planned everything and we had our reception at my parents house. My mom made my wedding dress, our reception food was from the local deli and my aunt made our wedding cake. We did rent a small chapel, I believe that was the largest expense and it was a perfect ceremony for us. \\nMy fiancee and I are getting so caught up in our own issues that planning a wedding that we agree upon is impossible. We\\'re taking time to work on ourselves, first, together, instead of freaking out about some one superficial day. Thanks for reminding me about the important values of that day, and that waiting until you can make it right for everyone is a valid choice, and that if it\\'s \"meant to be\" you\\'ll get there as soon as you are able. \\nCongratulations!! :D\\nCongratulations! And thanks for all the advice you\\'ve given us in the past. I certainly needed it. \\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding!  :)  It\\'s not always easy being married but it is always worth it.  \\nCongratulations!  My husband and I got married in a tree grove in a large city park---19 years ago.  It feels like yesterday--it\\'s been wonderful.  I wish you and your SO the same.\\n\\nCheers.\\n'"
